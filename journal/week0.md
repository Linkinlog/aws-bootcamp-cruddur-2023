## Proof of Work:

### User creation
- First I created a new IAM user for myself and gave it access to the billing console. I did this by signing in on my root user and going to the IAM section, I created a new user and then made a new policy that is only for IAM/Billing. I then restricted that access to having MFA set up as well using the same policy.

### Billing alert creation
- I then went into the cloudwatch management console, after adding that as a permission to my IAM user.
- I created a billing alarm so I could be alerted anytime the bill exceeds 1 it will email my personal email.
- I then went into the budgets section and created a zero spend budget
