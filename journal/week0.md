## Homework Challenges:

- [ ] Research the technical and service limits of specific services and how they could impact the technical path for technical flexibility.
- [ ] Open a support ticket and request a service limit

## Proof of Work:

### User creation

- First I created a new IAM user for myself and gave it access to the billing console. I did this by signing in on my root user and going to the IAM section, I created a new user and then made a new policy that is only for IAM/Billing. I then restricted that access to having MFA set up as well using the same policy.

### Billing alert creation

- I then went into the cloudwatch management console, after adding that as a permission to my IAM user.
- I created a billing alarm so I could be alerted anytime the bill exceeds 1 it will email my personal email.
- I then went into the budgets section and created a zero spend budget

### Lucid Charts

- I made my conceptual diagram [here](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/cd783c5c-0d8d-4a40-bd7d-73354b24d076/edit?viewport_loc=-354%2C-272%2C2272%2C1961%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_0084f3d1-04eb-457b-9a04-bd5475d142c8)
  - ![Conceptual diagram](../_docs/assets/week0/conceptual_diagram.png)
- And my logical diagram [here](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/37726de4-a2f9-4016-bbb7-5567e5444b58/edit?viewport_loc=2%2C98%2C1561%2C1278%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_9d71a71f-0c59-4efb-b6b5-49786be43256)

### GitPod

- I set up my gitpod container with a task to install the aws cli tool
- I confirmed it all worked and that the aws tool exists in the path
  - ![aws cli proof](../_docs/assets/week0/aws_cli.png)
- I set up my env variables scoped to the repo
